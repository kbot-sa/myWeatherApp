#Weather App version 1.0

This is a simple weather app built with vite + react. It uses the 'Open Weathermap' API to retrieve current weather information. It has a searchbar with a search button, on search, it displays:
- an icon indicative of the weather
- the city/region
- temperature (in degrees celcius)
- humidity (in percentage)
- windspeed (in km/h)

Some future updates will be added to this project, such as: 
- responsiveness
- restyled in a framework (such as bootstrap or tailwind)
- improved styling of the search icon
- more weather icons for various conditions
- chain else if statements replaced with switch statements
- on first loadup it will display the weather of your approximate location
- search on keypress 'Enter'
